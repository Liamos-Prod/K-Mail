The K-Mail is initially designed for Kanabae, a french electro-rock band. You should defenetly check their Spotify :) 
It was designed for long lists of E-mail sending to find gigs to play at, to send them a personnalized E-Mail without having any mistakes made. 

It is a non spamming app that sends mail at your ( relative ) speed but changing the names and places of who and where they were looking at. 

It is linked to google drive so they would just have to type in a giant sheet the names / email addresses and places of the potential gigs, and then by writting an E-mail, it would automatically switch the names and places, with the current data retrieved from googlesheet :
